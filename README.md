**Project Melampo** is an experimental open-source framework designed to evolve Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) into **Computer-Aided Intuition (CAI)**. 

By integrating **3D Swin Transformers** for volumetric analysis, **LLMs** for semantic reasoning, and **Quantum Cognition** principles for uncertainty management, Melampo aims to simulate the "clinical intuition" of an expert physician.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

Melampo operates on a hybrid neuro-quantum paradigm:

1.  **Multimodal Ingestion (The Eyes & Ears):**
    * **Visual:** 3D Swin Transformers for CT/MRI volumetric analysis.
    * **Textual:** Domain-specific LLMs (e.g., Med-PaLM 2 adapters) for report understanding.
    * **Fusion:** Cross-Modal Attention Layers to align pixel regions with semantic concepts.

2.  **Plastic Memory (The Brain):**
    * **MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning):** For few-shot adaptation to rare pathologies.
    * **Prototypical Networks:** Mapping diseases in a metric space rather than binary classification.
    * **EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation):** To prevent catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning.

3.  **Synthetic Intuition Engine (The Mind):**
    * Uses **Quantum Probability** (Hilbert Spaces) to model diagnostic uncertainty.
    * Simulates neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Noradrenaline) to modulate the "temperature" of the diagnostic wave function collapse.
    * **Generative Dreaming (VAE/GAN):** Offline processing to consolidate knowledge and generate synthetic training data for rare cases.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Roadmap

The project is currently in the **Conceptual & Architecture Design** phase. We are looking for contributors to help build the implementation layer.

- **Languages:** Python, C++ (for Quantum kernels)
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Vector DB:** Milvus or Weaviate
- **Quantum Simulation:** Qiskit or Pennylane

### Current Roadmap
- [x] Theoretical Framework Definition (Whitepaper)
- [ ] Setup of the Vector Knowledge Graph (Medical Ontology)
- [ ] Implementation of the 3D Swin Transformer Backbone
- [ ] Development of the Quantum-Probability Decision Layer

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome visionaries, data scientists, radiologists, and quantum computing researchers.
