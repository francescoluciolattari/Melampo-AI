**Melampo** is not just a classifier. It is a **Cognitive Architecture** designed to simulate the clinical reasoning process, bridging the gap between rigorous data analysis (Attention) and expert hunches (Intuition).

It introduces the concept of **"Computer-Aided Intuition" (CAI)** using a hybrid brain-like structure.

## 🧠 The Architecture: A2A (Area-to-Area)

Melampo simulates a biological brain with distinct functional areas connected via a global workspace.

### 1. Sensory Cortex (Ingestion & Attention)
* **Vision (The Eyes):** Utilizes **SwinUNETR (Monai)** for 3D Volumetric analysis (CT/MRI), preserving spatial depth often lost in standard CNNs.
* **Language (The Ears):** Integrating **BioMistral/Med-PaLM** adapters to understand nuance in medical reports (negation, uncertainty).
* **Fusion:** Late Fusion with **Cross-Modal Attention**, allowing text to "query" specific regions of the 3D volume.

### 2. Plastic Memory (Learning & Retention)
* **MAML (Meta-Learning):** The model "learns to learn," initializing weights to adapt to new pathologies with few-shot examples.
* **Prototypical Networks:** Diagnosis happens in a metric space by calculating distance to disease "Prototypes," not via binary classification.
* **EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation):** Prevents catastrophic forgetting, simulating synaptic consolidation.

### 3. The Intuition Engine (Quantum Cognition)
Standard AI uses binary logic. Melampo uses **Quantum Probability**:
* **Wave Function ($|\Psi\rangle$):** The patient's state is a superposition of potential diagnoses in a Complex Hilbert Space.
* **Interference:** Symptoms and findings interfere constructively or destructively based on the Hamiltonian matrix (Knowledge Graph).
* **Neurotransmitters:** The collapse of the wave function is modulated by synthetic neuro-parameters:
    * **Noradrenaline:** Controls "Temperature" (Focus vs. Exploration).
    * **Dopamine:** Reinforces confidence based on past rewards.

### 4. Dreaming Phase (Generative Offline Processing)
During inactivity, Melampo activates **VAE (Variational Autoencoders)** and **GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks)** to:
* Replay difficult cases (Reconsolidation).
* Generate synthetic scenarios (Data Augmentation).
* Create new connections in the Vector Knowledge Graph (Insight generation).
